## FYP Diary

Student: Kaiyu Chen

Supervisor: Diarmuid

### Fri, Sept 23rd

+ FYP supervisor allocation published on Moodle.

### Fri, Sept 30th

+ I contacted Kaiyu via Slack and requested his timetable to arrange a mutually suitable meeting time. I also enquired about the area he wished to focus on for his project. 
+ He replied with a timetable copy.

### Sun. Oct. 2nd

+ Kaiyu messaged me to indicate he was considering developing a mobile or web app. He also expressed that there needed to be more general direction about the FYP.

### Tue. Oct. 4th

+ I spoke with Kaiyu at the lab class (Agile S/W Practice). After a general discussion, I requested he think about a context/problem domain for the app idea and suggested he get back to me via Slack by Friday.

### Tue. Oct. 11th

+ Kaiyu decided on a Food Delivery context for the app. Also, the primary focus would be on the web app and React was the chosen technology as it is taught in the Web App Dev 2 module.
+ We had an arranged meeting the following day to discuss the context area in more depth. I proposed that Kaiyu prepare a project proposal document detailing the app's feature set and an outline data model.

### Mon. Oct. 17th

+ Received Project Proposal document via Slack. We arranged to meet the following Wednesday to discuss the proposal.

### Wed. Oct. 19th (Meeting)

+ The proposal was a good document, and Kaiyu expanded on some of its aspects, e.g. tracking of delivery using google maps. 
+ There is some concern about the proposed app's novelty, as many similar solutions are already in the market.
+ We discuss ways to strengthen the overall project proposal to maximise its potential for a high grade. As Kaiyu does not have an alternative context or problem domain for consideration, we decided to consider alternative technology stacks. 
+ Kaiyu suggested using Vue instead of React for the frontend; however, it may not be sufficiently challenging to impress an external examiner.
+ The AWS Amplify tool could incorporate several aspects of modern s/w development, e.g. cloud deployment, CI/CD.

Plan - Kaiyu should deploy the React Movies App (from the Web App Dev module) to AWS using the Amplify service.
Wed. 


### Wed. Oct 26th (Meeting)
+ Kaiyu successfully deployed the Movies App using the Amplify tool - this is a good start.
+ We agreed that the next step is to explore the backend and look at how Amplify structures it. As an experiment,
Kaiyu would try to build a skeleton backend for posting reviews from the Movie App. This task would be challenging but worthwhile even if only partially achieved. 
+ We introduced the term serverless, which is the architecture Amplify promotes. It could be a theme for the project.

### Thu. Nov 10th  (Meeting)

+ Met after the mid-term break to discuss the outcome of the experimental work with the Amplify service. 
+ Kaiyu could not work on the FYP due to other assignment commitments. He did watch a video tutorial on developing a basic full-stack web app using Amplify.
+ This is a significant setback in progress. A prototype is essential to this FYP's semester one deliverable because it uses the Agile methodology.

Plan - 
+ Agreed to redouble the effort to produce the skeleton backend for the Movies App in time for the next meeting.

### Tue. Nov 15th  (Slack conversation)
+ Kaiyu informed me he can still not allocate time to the FYP due to other modules' assignments - Web App Dev 2 and Agile S/w Practice.
+ We agreed that a face-to-face meeting would not be beneficial this week, but he will update me via Slack if he progresses with the prototype before our next meeting (next week).

### Tue. Nov 22nd.
+ There was no meeting this week despite two attempts to identify a suitable time slot, as Kaiyu had to cancel both.
